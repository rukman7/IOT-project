# Final year project
Temperature monitoring using IoT
-> The temperature data from a DHT11 sensor 
is pushed to the website using HTTP POST method from
Arduino microcontroller.
The website is backed by PHP.
The temperature and humidity values are printed in a html page
and also they are stored in a MySQL data base.
From the values and timestamps in the database table
it is possible to make temperature and humidity prediction
by applying a simple machine learning algorithm at the backend.

External file transfer client filezilla is used.
